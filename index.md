I am an Applied Scientist at [Tiime Software](https://www.tiime.fr/), where I work on Generative AI applications for the accounting domain. Prior to this, I obtained my PhD in Machine Learning at Grenoble Computer Science Laboratory, University Grenoble Alpes under the supervision of two amazing people [Denis Trystram](https://datamove.imag.fr/denis.trystram/) and [Nguyen Kim Thang](https://datamove.imag.fr/kimthang.nguyen/). 

In the summer 2023, I was a visiting PhD student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/), where I worked on Knowledge Distillation and Federated Learning. I hold Master's degree in Random Modelling from the University Paris Diderot and a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics from Sorbonne University

Currently, I'm interested in multi-agent systems, optimization/machine learning and bandit problems.
