Welcome to my personal page :)

**Short bio** : I am a PhD Student at Grenoble Computer Science Laboratory - University Grenoble Alpes under the supervision of two amazing people [Denis Trystram](https://datamove.imag.fr/denis.trystram/) and [Nguyen Kim Thang](https://datamove.imag.fr/kimthang.nguyen/). Prior to this, I completed a Master's degree in Random Modeling at University Paris Diderot and a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics at Sorbonne University. I visited the SaCS Lab in EPFL during summer 2023, where I worked on Knowledge Distillation. I also completed an internship at SNCF Réseau, focusing on anomaly detection as part of my end-of-study internship.

Currently, my research interests lie in optimization, machine learning and distributed system. From time to time, I also delve into the topics of bandit and reinforcement learning, and of course, I can't not escape from the recent trend in LLM, especially building RAG system for domain-specific applications.
